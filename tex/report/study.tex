\section{Experiment script}
\label{app:study}

\subsection{Introduction}
``You are here to participate in a short experiment where you will assist in the design of an application called TIDE.
The experiment will last about 30 minutes and will be recorded, both as audio and video.
I will give you instructions by reading from this script.
After an introduction you will be able to ask questions, then we will start the experiment.

First, let me introduce TIDE.
TIDE is an application that connects a smartphone (iPhone) with a tabletop computer (Microsoft Surface).
It allows you to interact with your phone on a larger screen, by transferring the display of your phone to a window on the screen of the interactive surface.
Do you understand the basic concept of the application?

During this experiment, I will ask you to perform a task using the application.
This will lead you to perform a number of actions that use the basic features of TIDE.
For each action, there will be 3 steps:

\begin{itemize}
\item{First, I will explain the action, and show you its effect on this screen}
\item{Second, I will ask you to describe to me how you would suggest performing this action with the user interface of TIDE.}
\item{Third, I will give you 3 suggestions of how to perform the action, and ask you to order them according to your preference.}
\end{itemize}

This experiment is based on prototypes, which means that we will use the available paper representations, in order to describe the user interface of TIDE.
There are iPhone screenshots and different types of buttons and controls.
Paper, pen and scissors are available for building your own prototypes if necessary.
You are welcome to draw on the prototypes as needed.
We will also use the iPhone, the MS Surface, and of course verbal communication.
\hfill\\
This iPhone screenshot printout is a representation of the main window of the TIDE application.
The idea is that you can interact with this window in exactly the same way as you would interact with your phone's screen.
For example, by tapping the Photos icon, you would launch the Photos application, and if you are viewing a picture, by performing a two finger pinching gesture, you could zoom on the picture.
At the same time, we need a way to manipulate the window, and that is what the focus of this experiment
\hfill\\
Do you have any questions concerning the general course of the experiment?
\hfill\\
Let us begin.
Your general task is to write an email to a friend using your iPhone and the TIDE application on the Microsoft Surface.
We will talk about 7 basic actions.''

\subsubsection{Example: Pairing}
\hfill\\
This first action is only an example, meaning that I will go through all the steps.
The action is called pairing.
\hfill\\
\hfill\\
\emph{Scenario:}
In order to use TIDE, I have to pair my iPhone with the Surface and launch the TIDE application.
Here is a visual representation of the effect of this application (the designer shows a PowerPoint animation that describes the command).
\hfill\\
\hfill\\
\emph{Suggestion:}\\
I asked my friend Juan, and his suggestion was to launch TIDE on the iPhone, then search for available surface computers within the application,  and connect to the Surface.
\hfill\\
\hfill\\
\emph{Selection:}
\begin{description}
\item[A]{The application launches automatically when the smartphone is placed on the surface, and a dialog window appears on the smartphone, offering the user to establish the connection.}
\item[B]{The application launches automatically when the smartphone is placed on the surface, and 2 dialog windows appear, first on the surface, then on the smartphone, offering the user to establish the connection.}
\item[C]{The application launches automatically when the smartphone is close enough to the surface, and a dialog window appears on the surface, offering the user to establish the connection.}
\end{description}

Juans order of preference was B, A, C.
What about you?
\hfill\\
\hfill\\
There are 6 actions left, and I will now show you visual representations for each of those actions (the designer shows a PowerPoint animation that describes the commands).

\subsection{Experiment}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% DRAGGING

\subsubsection{Dragging}
\emph{Scenario:}
Your iPhone screen is now active on the surface, and you need to move it closer to yourself. Therefore, you drag the window across the surface.
\hfill\\
\hfill\\
\emph{Suggestion}
\hfill\\
\hfill\\
\emph{Selection (group 1)}
\begin{description}
\item[A]{By performing a one finger dragging gesture on a specific action tab. (1)}
\item[B]{By performing a one finger dragging gesture on the action bar. (2)}
\item[C]{By tapping a tab to render the window inactive, then performing a one finger dragging gesture anywhere on the window. (3)}
\end{description}
\hfill\\
\emph{Selection (group 2)}
\begin{description}
\item[A]{By performing a one finger dragging gesture on the active border of the window. (4)}
\item[B]{By performing a one finger dragging gesture on the active border (excl. corners) of the window. (5)}
\item[C]{By holding a finger on a specific tab, and using another finger to tap a destination target to move the window to. (6)}
\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% ROTATING

\subsubsection{Rotating}
\emph{Scenario:}
the application window is not oriented correctly, so you need to rotate it to the correct orientation. 
\hfill\\
\hfill\\
\emph{Suggestion}
\hfill\\
\hfill\\
\emph{Selection (group 1)}
\begin{description}
\item[A]{By performing a two finger touch rotating gesture on the action bar. (2)}
\item[B]{By tapping a tab to render the window inactive, then performing a two finger touch rotating gesture anywhere on the window. (3)}
\item[C]{By performing a two finger touch rotating gesture on the active border. (4)}
\end{description}
\hfill\\
\emph{Selection (group 2)}
\begin{description}
\item[A]{By performing a two finger touch rotating gesture on the active border. (5)}
\item[B]{By performing a one finger dragging gesture on a corner of the window. (6)}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% RESIZING

\subsubsection{Resizing}

\emph{Scenario:}
