%Due to their relevance to the current project, the following aspects of device composition are reviewed: smart spaces, pairing, UI distribution and tabletops.
%Lastly, the main approaches to designing user interaction for device composition between mobile devices and larger displays are presented.

\section{Device composition and tabletops}

%DEVICE COMPOSITION is an approach that can solve this.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\emph{Device composition} is an important element of the ubiquitous computing research area, and the main background of this thesis.
An essential aspect of ubiquitous computing is the idea that users can benefit freely from the resources that are available in the environment.
%Device composition started with SMART ROOMS, and composing various devices, which we want to do in this case.
%But smart rooms were designed as closed environments.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Extensive research focused on realizing that idea by designing computer augmented spaces, or \emph{smart rooms}, where heterogeneous devices can interoperate.
Examples of such smart spaces are Augmented Surfaces \citep{Rekimoto:1999:augmentedsurfaces}, 
%where portable devices and interactive surfaces are enabled for data exchange; 
\mbox{i-LAND} \citep{Streitz:1999:iland} and the Interactive Workspaces \citep{Johanson:2002:iroom}.
Beside device interaction, these projects were aimed at supporting collaborative work between collocated users.
Smart rooms are usually closed computing environments that rely on a centralized software infrastructure, such as BEACH developed for i-LAND \citep{Tandler:2001:smartenv}, or Gaia OS for Active Spaces \citep{Roman:2002:gaia}.
The advantage of such an approach is that the interaction between the enabled devices can be hugely optimized, as they shared a set of semantics.
However, the drawback is that new devices cannot be integrated easily, requiring at least a software installation or configuration.

%We would like AD-HOC, spontaneous device composition.
%That was addressed by projects like Obje, CompUTE, Platform Composition.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
To bring device composition outside of the smart rooms, systems have been built, that support a more ad-hoc form of device interaction.
Obje \citep{Edwards:2009:obje} is a middleware that relies on services transferring mobile code to achieve device compatibility at runtime.
It allows devices to interoperate upon their very first encounter, but relies on the user's semantic interpretation to do so.
\cite{Pering:2009:platformcomp} focused on understanding ad-hoc collaboration using pervasive technologies, and suggested Platform Composition as a technique to support collaborative work by using a combination of standard computing components.
\cite{Bardram:2010:compute} developed CompUTE, a runtime architecture for device composition  on Windows XP systems based on the extended desktop metaphor.

% END WITH TABLETOP
\emph{Tabletop displays} are an recurring element in research projects that address device composition.
They present two important characteristics.
First, they are \emph{situated}, i.e.\ due to their size, they typically sit in a location and are not moved frequently.
Second, they are \emph{shared} among multiple users, mostly due to their horizontal interactive surfaces that allow users to attend from all angles and engage in face-to-face interaction.
For these reasons, tabletops seem to be best used in combination with the mobile devices carried around by users, especially when they sit in a public space.

Even though early systems such as the DigitalDesk \citep{Wellner:1993:digitaldesk} were designed for the individual office desk, most of the research on tabletops has been focused on their potential as support for collocated collaboration.
Thanks to technology advances such as DiamondTouch \citep{Dietz:2001:diamondtouch},
% that combines overhead projected output with capacitively sensed input,
tabletops support multiple simultaneous touch input, and thus simultaneous users.
They are an essential element of smart spaces, with systems such as the InteracTable for the i-LAND \citep{Streitz:1999:iland} and the iTable for the iRoom \citep{Johanson:2002:iroom}.
Other projects have shown that they are an ideal tool to support collaboration, with systems such as the MemTable \citep{Hunter:2011:memtable}, that permits the capture and recall of meetings, or SketchTop \citep{Clifton:2010:sketchtop}, a multitouch sketching application for collocated design collaboration.

Another basic characteristic of tabletops is the horizontal orientation of their interactive surface.
The obvious implication is that physical objects can be placed on them.
Much work has gone into the detection and tracking of such objects, with systems such as SurfaceFusion \citep{Olwal:2008:surfacefusion}, where the authors used a combination of RFID technology to sense the presence of objects and computer vision to track their precise location.
Tracking techniques can be used to detect other computing devices, and can therefore help to solve certain challenges of device composition.

% tangible interaction %
%The integration of innate objects to tabletop systems has given rise to a research branch called \emph{tangible interaction} ..
%
%There is basically two ways to integrate physical objects to interactive surface.
%The first one is to use the objects as a tangible user interface (TUI), a notion that was introduced with the MetaDESK \citep{Ullmer:1997:metadesk}.
%The second approach has for purpose to augment objects with digital information.
%Examples of this approach include SurfaceWare \citep{Dietz:2009:surfaceware}, which allows the Microsoft Surface to sense the fluid level in a slightly enhanced drinking glass, and the Rabbit \citep{Hincapie:2011:rabbit}, a device that integrates small RFID-tagged objects and tabletops.

In recent years, tabletops are being commercialized, and gradually appear in public spaces such as firm lobbies, shops, bars and restaurants.
For example, the Microsoft Surface is part of the furniture in the new retail stores of the Royal Bank of Canada \citep{mscase}, offering service applications to the visiting customers.
This tendency gives rise to a new type of tabletop interaction, more spontaneous, and targeting non technical users.
It is within this context that the present work is set.

The task of the present work is to design a composite device made up of a smartphone and a tabletop for spontaneous user interaction.
This task poses three fundamental challenges: device pairing, distributing the user interface and designing the user interaction.

\section{Pairing}

\emph{Pairing} is the procedure through which two devices first discover each other, then connect to each other for interaction.
It is an essential part of any device composition, and a challenge that can be solved in different ways.

Some systems are designed for networked devices, and achieve pairing with TCP/IP based networking protocols such as Zeroconf \citeyearpar{zeroconf} for Obje and UPnP \citeyearpar{upnp} for CompUTE.

Bluetooth \citeyearpar{bluetooth} supports a device discovery protocol that was used by the Personal Server \citep{Want:2002:personalserver}.
It allows the pairing of any bluetooth-enabled device, but the process has been shown to be slow, and can be inefficient if there are multiple devices in the vicinity.

In systems that allow for spontaneous interaction between wireless mobile devices, additional techniques must be used to permit the identification of the correct device.
A way to do that is by detecting synchronous events, like with the Smart-its \citep{Holmquist:2001:smartits}, that connect when they are held and shaken together; and SyncTap \citep{Rekimoto:2003:synctap}, that requires the same key to be simultaneously pressed on both devices.

Another technique that has been used to connect mobile devices to a situated one, e.g.\ a large display, is to have the display present a random key to be entered on the mobile device.
The key can take the form of an alphanumeric string, a sequence of motions \citep{Patel:2004:mobileauth}, or a visual pattern \citep{Ballagas:2005:sweeppointshoot, Scott:2005:visualauth}.
This approach allows authentication, but adds steps to the pairing process.

Established RFID technologies can be used for device association, but requires that the mobile device is equipped with the appropriate tag, and that the situated device presents an RFID reader.
Upcoming NFC techniques present the great advantage that devices can function both as reader and transmitter, but few commercial devices are equipped as of yet.

Computer vision can be used to detect specific shapes, such as phone-like objects.
It can make the pairing process easier, as shown with the BlueTable \citep{Wilson:2007:bluetable}, an interactive surface that uses vision techniques and Bluetooth to pair with a mobile phone.

\section{UI distribution}

Device composition has been extensively used for building systems that allow the sharing of user interfaces between devices.
The typical setup is to be able to view and interact with the data and applications from a mobile device on a situated one that offers superior display resources.
There are various technologies for UI distribution.

One way is to distribute only the data to the larger display, such as was done for the iRoom \citep{Johanson:2002:iroom}, but this approach is only applicable when both devices have the same software installed.

Another possibility is to distribute code, sending whole applications to the situated device for execution.
However, there are a series of issues with such an approach.
The situated device might not be able to run the application, either because of compatibility problems (hardware, software) or because the device might choose not to trust unknown code.
Software can be compiled into platform-independent code, such as is the case for Flash \citep{flash}, Java \citep{java} and Silverlight \citep{silverlight}.
However, issues remain, that are mostly related to the excessive size of the data files and the security risks.
\\
\linebreak
Distributing graphics is generally a preferred approach, because it allows to keep user data and credentials on the mobile device, and it has better potential for responsive interaction.
Systems such as X-Windows (X11) \citep{Scheifler:1986:x11}, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) \citep{Tritsch:2003:rdp} and Virtual Network Computing (VNC) \citep{Richardson:1998:vnc} utilize rendering-based protocols for UI distribution.
Applications are executed on a device, and rendered on another.
These protocols are stable, but they are based on the assumption that the machine executing the application has important resources.
When combining mobile and situated devices, however, the situation is reversed: the computer with the greater resources renders the graphics.

Another way of distributing graphics is by using web-based protocols, where Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Hypertext Mark-up Language (HTML) are used to send and present the application.
Such an approach can either be built on a web server model, which is basically what we use when we log on to websites via a browser, or on a personal server model, which is what the Personal Server \citep{Want:2002:personalserver} was based on.
The Personal Server is a handheld device without a display, that transmits HTML pages to available displays in the environment.
Using a web-based protocol implies a series of drawbacks that are induced by the use of HTML: browsers behave differently, HTML 1 to 4 does not support generalized drawing, HTML does not handle varying display sizes and resolutions and the use of Javascript introduces security issues related to programmable display.

Recent research efforts have been invested in the development of whole frameworks that can support flexible UI distribution.
This is the case with XICE (eXtending Interactive Computing Everywhere) \citep{Arthur:2011:xice}, a programming framework that uses wireless networks to connect portable devices to display servers.
It takes into account the limited CPU and battery capacities of mobile devices, and provides a flexible protocol that allows the annexation of different types of displays.

Substance \citep{Gjerlufsen:2011:substance} was designed to support the development of interactive multi-surface applications.
It is a data-oriented programming model that was used to build Shared Substance, a middleware that provides powerful sharing applications.

%Device composition has been steadily gaining importance due to the growing multiplicity of computing devices and mobility of users.
%Nowadays, a typical user owns mobile computers (handheld, tablet, laptop, etc\ldots) and interacts with other devices in an ad hoc way, as s/he comes upon them throughout the day (public desktops, printers, displays, etc\ldots).
%Enabling efficient communication and collaboration between various devices is therefore an essential issue, with the overall goal of improving the user experience.

%Device composition focuses on the following challenges:
%\begin{description}
%\item[Connection:] this includes device detection, identification and connection.
%\item[Communication:] different types of devices (hardware, OS) must use a common language if they are to collaborate.   
%\item[Sharing:] collaboration often requires sharing information. Besides technical problems, this raises the privacy issue of protecting the user's personal data.
%\item[Interaction:] the user must be able to interact with the system if s/he is to benefit from it.

\section{User interaction}

Combining mobile devices with larger displays is not a new idea.
It is already widely available for laptop computers, that can be connected via a cable---such as VGA or DVI---to external monitors, projectors, etc.
There are serious limitations to this type of setup.
Some are technical: said cables are limited in terms of graphical output, the large size of the connectors is prohibitive on mobile devices; and others are related to the user experience: the user must have the required cable, the user must find the connector on the larger display, the process of connecting/disconnecting is susceptible to take time.
This work focuses therefore on providing a wireless user experience.

Recent research efforts have shown that there are different approaches to improving the experience of the smartphone user by allowing the extension of the phone UI to an available display surface.
The main approaches are listed here in terms of the interaction metaphor that they are based on.

\emph{Streaming} is a straightforward approach where only the visual output of the mobile device is forwarded to a remote display.
It is what happens when we connect a laptop to a projector, for example to give a presentation.
This is a satisfying solution in specific situations, and present the advantage of being secure, because input is kept to the mobile device.
However, it presents serious limitations in terms of interaction potential.

\emph{Replication} goes one step further, by allowing the user to provide input on the replicated UI.
This type of integration is already available for personal computers, but requires using a cable, or a docking station.

\emph{Expansion} is when the larger display becomes additional space for the existing UI of the mobile device.
It is also available for laptops via a cable or docking station.
It provides the possibility of transferring data or applications to the remote  machine, while preserving the integrality of the mobile UI.

\emph{Projection} is a metaphor similar to replication, with the difference that the mobile device itself is used for projecting its UI onto an available display surface.
\cite{Winkler:2011:interactivephonecall} have built a device composed of a smartphone and a personal projector, that provide powerful in-call collaboration features, by projecting a shared interface on any available surface.
Virtual Projection (VP) \citep{Baur:2012:virtualprojection} is a system where a smartphone can be used to project its UI onto an available display.

\emph{Adaptation} refers to an improved UI transfer where the UI is modified to make full use of the additional resources available on the remote display.
This approach was followed by the authors of XICE \citep{Arthur:2011:xice}.

Additionally, the system is built on standard hardware, and is compatible with most smartphone types.
