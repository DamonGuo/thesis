\section{Experiment}

\subsection{Pairing}
\hfill\\
This first action is an example, meaning that I will go through all the steps myself.
The action is called pairing.
In order to use Displex, I have to pair my iPhone with the Surface and launch the Displex application. Here is a visual representation of the effect of this application.
(SHOW PPF)
\\\\
\emph{Open suggestion??}\\
I launch Displex on my iPhone, search the local network for available Surface computers, and connect to the Surface.
\\\\
\emph{Guided suggestions}
\begin{description}
\item[A]{The application launches automatically when the smartphone is placed on the surface, and a dialog window appears on the smartphone, offering the user to establish the connection.}
\item[B]{The application launches automatically when the smartphone is placed on the surface, and 2 dialog windows appear, first on the surface, then on the smartphone, offering the user to establish the connection.}
\item[C]{The application launches automatically when the smartphone is close enough to the surface, and a dialog window appears on the surface, offering the user to establish the connection.}
\end{description}

My order of preference is B, A, C.
