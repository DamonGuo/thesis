STRUCTURE AND ORGANIZE A RESEARCH PAPER

Introduction: tell your story. Don't forget "the rest of this paper is presented as follows.."

Method: tell how you did it: call it Method, with subsections: participants, apparatus, procedure, design (independent/dependent variables), results. Don't be creative. Methodology.
Research must be reproducible, it is like a recipe

Results and discussion: move from overall to detailed results. don't give too much, filter what is important, discuss the results, explain. Statistics are only a support for the result. 

Conclusion: summarize and restate findings, no new ideas
