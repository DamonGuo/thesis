DEVICE COMPOSITION ON TABLETOPS

Smartphones: the only personal computer that we need.
computing power, data storage, network connectivity + small size:
	carry personal data and applications anywhere.
However, limited UI.

On the other hand, tabletop computers
- cutting-edge technology
- UI potential
- new possibilities HCI

Many research projects:
- research oriented: interaction techniques (physical device integration)
- domain specific: museum, bar, shop
- game oriented

Currently, tabletops are rare devices (expensive, cumbersome, lack of software)
BUT they will become mainstream, our focus:
	facilitating their adoption by everyday citizens in everyday context.

Approach: UI peripheral only
Reasons:
- avoid rewriting applications for a new platform
- avoid confusing the user with new applications
- tabletops are public: personalized use + data privacy

Solution: integration between smartphone and tabletop by way of UI transfer (mirror / nesting) + focus on seamless user experience and implicit HCI.

5 Challenges:
- Setup: enable communication between devices
- Discovery: connect devices
- Output via UI transfer: project the phone's UI on the tabletop
- Input: send input from device to table
- Interaction Design: application design and interaction techniques?

Software components:
- iPhone daemon: VNC server
- iPhone daemon: detect onTable event, UDP broadcast
- MS application: VNC client, OpenCV, UI application

Current status + show prototypes
